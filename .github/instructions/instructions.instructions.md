Use markdown formatting for any text in the --body section when using the command 'gh issue' for github CLI.

Instead of asking to be told when things happening in the CLI are finished, check the CLI like an Agent should.


After running 'git push', always run 'git status' and report the result, instead of saying "Iâ€™ll let you know as soon as the push is complete."

For command chaining in PowerShell, always use ';' instead of '&&'.
